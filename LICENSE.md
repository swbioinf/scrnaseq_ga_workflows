Note that CellRanger is subject to a [custom licence](https://github.com/10XGenomics/cellranger/blob/master/LICENSE). Most notably, it can only be used with 10X technology. Any use of these workflows that use these cellRanger must adhere to that licence. 

An alternative option is the STARsolo, distributed under an MIT licence. 

Otherwise, useage of these workflows is depenant on the (generally permissive) licences of the underlying tools and platforms; including;

* [Cell Ranger](https://github.com/10XGenomics/cellranger/blob/master/LICENSE)
* [STARSolo](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/blob/master/LICENSE)
* [Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/admin/license/)
* [Galaxy Australia terms of service](https://site.usegalaxy.org.au/about#terms-of-service)
* [Scanpy](https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/blob/master/LICENSE\)
